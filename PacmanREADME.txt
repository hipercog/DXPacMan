The goal of Pacman is to score as high as possible before you are finally killed by the ghosts. 
You score 10 points by eating the dots which fill each maze, and you lose 1 life by colliding with the ghosts. However, in each level there are four 'power pills', which score 50 points each and additionally allow you to eat the ghosts for a limited time. Eating ghosts scores the highest points of all, 100 for the first and doubling thereafter. But beware! Chasing after the ghosts is a good way to lose lives for the unskilled player.
As the levels advance, the ghosts will get faster, more aggressive, and run away for less time when you eat a Pill. Use the teleporters at the sides of the level to get some brething space in later levels.

This Pacman is non-standard, it contains some features not present in the original and lacks other features.
Notably, there are only two ghosts, there is only one fruit, and instead of extra points the fruit gives you 1 extra life. Control of Pacman is based on key presses, so is very intuitive (but may feel slightly different to the veteran player).

Good eating!
